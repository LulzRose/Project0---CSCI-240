# Project0---CSCI-240
Here is Project zero for my CSCI 240 Class

The goal for this file is as follows:

CSCI 240 	Fall 2018
Program 0
Training
(5 points)
Due: Friday, August 31 by 11:59 PM
Overview

The purpose of this assignment is to learn how to use a C++ compiler and write a short C++ program.

There are a lot of different C++ compilers available to write and run C++ program. The compilers that we recommend for this course are:

    Windows PC: Dev C++
    Mac: XCode

Familiarize yourself with one of the two compilers by completing the steps listed in one of the following documents:

    Dev-C++ compiler: http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~byrnes/csci240/dev2.htm

    XCode: http://faculty.cs.niu.edu/~byrnes/csci240/xcode.htm

Note: if you're familiar with another C++ compiler, it may also be used to complete the assignment. Just make sure to use the sample program and other code from one of the two documents (some of it is found in later steps) and use it with the other compiler.

Once all of the steps have been completed, submit the source code file that was created (the one with the CPP extension) on Blackboard.
